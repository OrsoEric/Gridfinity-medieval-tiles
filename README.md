# Gridfinity-medieval-tiles

Gridfinity tiles inspired by carcassone compatible with gridfinity base plate.

Meant to use to make D&D modular dungeons like overworld maps and dungeons.

## Gridfinity Base Plate

Found the skinniest base plate. There are plates that incorporate magnets and screw.

## Gridfinity Tile - Grass

My first tile! I combined a gridfinity base tile 1x1 with a fractal terrain generation algorithm to get grass. Changing the seed and the parameter allow to generate lots of unique grass tiles.
